## Step 1. Subscribe to a script

1. Go to the [Android real-time anti-cheat management page](#/console/service/confront) or [iOS real-time anti-cheat management page](#/console/service/ios-confront) and find the script-based defense page in the public section.
2. View the feature description of each module, select the modules based on your game needs, and toggle on the subscription or forced quit switch (multiple items can be selected).

## Step 2. Confirm the release channel

After subscribing to the required modules, you can combine and release them to the client for cheat defense. This process can be implemented in either of the following methods:

### Method 1: game's own characteristic release channel <font color="#dd0000">(recommended)</font>

#### Directions

1. Switch to the **Test Server** tab on the real-time anti-cheat management page and subscribe to and release the required modules.

2. Switch to the **History** tab on the real-time anti-cheat management page and click **Download Characteristic**.

<span class="legend">Figure 3. Characteristic download</span>

3. After downloading a characteristic, you can use the method of connecting the SDK to an Android game in C or C# to deliver it to the game client and then call an API to pass it to the SDK client.

#### Android game in C

**Function prototype**

```c++
int tss_sdk_ioctl(int request, const void *param, char *buf, size_t buf_size, size_t *used_buf_len) 
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--------|-----|
| request | Request code. Enter the request code `TssSDKCmd_RecvSecSignature` for pushing the characteristic or `34`. |
| param | Characteristic information, which is fixed as a pointer to the `TssSecSignature` structure. |
| buf | This parameter is useless. Enter `NULL`. |
| buf_size | This parameter is useless. Enter `0`. |
| userd_buf_len | This parameter is useless. Enter `NULL`. |

```c
struct TssSecSignature
{
    const char *name_;          // Characteristic file name
    const unsigned char *buf_;  // Characteristic content
    size_t buf_len_;            // Characteristic content length
    uint32_t crc_;              //  Characteristic content CRC checksum
};

enum TssSdkRequestCmdID
{
…
    TssSDKCmd_RecvSecSignature = 34,
…
};
```

**Call time sequence**

```xml
It can be called at any time after the `tp2_sdk_init_ex` function is called.
```

```cpp
TssSecSignature info = {0}
info.name_ = "tssmua2.zip";         // Replace the value with the actual characteristic name
info.buf_ = tssmua2_data;           // Point to the actual `buf` pointer
info.buf_len_ = tssmua2_data_len;  // Enter the actual characteristic size
info.crc_ = tssmua2_crc;            // Enter the actual characteristic CRC

// After `tp2_sdk_init_ex` is called, there is no blocking
tss_sdk_ioctl(TssSDKCmd_RecvSecSignature, (const void *)&info, NULL, 0, NULL);
```

#### Android game in C#

**Function prototype**

```csharp
int Tp2RecvSecSignature(string name, byte[] buf, UInt32 buf_len, UInt32 crc)
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description |
|--------|-----|
| name | Characteristic name, which is fixed as `tssmua2.zip` |
| buf | Actual `buf` pointer |
| buf_size | Actual characteristic size |
| crc | Actual characteristic CRC value |

```csharp
// Add the following code to the `Tp2Sdk` namespace of `tp2.cs` or contact the relevant personnel to get the `tp2.cs` file
#if UNITY_IOS
	[DllImport("__Internal")]
#else
    [DllImport("tersafe2")]
#endif
    private static extern int tss_recv_sec_signature(string name,
        byte[] data, UInt32 data_len, UInt32 crc);

    public static int Tp2RecvSecSignature(string name,
        byte[] buf, UInt32 buf_len, UInt32 crc)
    {
        return tss_recv_sec_signature(name, buf, buf_len, crc);
    }
```

**Call time sequence**

```xml
It can be called at any time after the `Tp2SdkInitEx` function is called.
```

```csharp
string name = "tssmua2.zip";   // Replace the value with the actual characteristic name
byte[] buf = tssmua2_data;     // Point to the actual `buf` pointer
uint buf_len = tssmua2_data_len;  // Enter the actual characteristic size
uint crc = tssmua2_crc;  // Enter the actual characteristic CRC

// After `Tp2SdkInitEx` is called, there is no blocking
Tp2Sdk.Tp2RecvSecSignature(name, buf, buf_len, crc);
```

### Method 2: SDK's default delivery channel

#### Notes

The characteristic distribution channel of the SDK is separate from the game channel; therefore, cheaters can easily block the connection between the SDK and the server to stop the characteristics from being distributed. We recommend you build a characteristic release channel for your game. If you still want to distribute characteristics on the platform, before releasing them to the production server, you must test them on the test server and check for exceptions in the crash information. Characteristics can be distributed to the production server only after the tests are passed.

After the release, if the game has an exception, you can switch to the **History** tab on the [Android real-time anti-cheat management page](#/console/service/confront) or [iOS real-time anti-cheat management page](#/console/service/ios-confront) and click **Remove** for the released characteristics. After removal, the characteristics in the original release environment will be deleted, and the game will have no defense effect of the modules.

#### Directions

1. You must test characteristics on the test server and check for exceptions in the crash information before releasing them. They can be distributed to the production server only after the tests are passed.
2. Switch to the **Test Server** tab on the real-time anti-cheat management page and subscribe to and release the required modules.

<span class="legend">Figure 4. Characteristic release on test server</span>

3. Switch to the **Production Server** tab on the real-time anti-cheat management page after the tests are passed, select modules subscribed to on the test server, and release.

## Step 3. Block cheats

After a characteristic is distributed, the SDK will detect cheats locally and broadcast the detection result data. You can also develop policies on the server based on the reported data for targeted defense.
