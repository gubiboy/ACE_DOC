### Solution use cases

If your game encounters a custom cheat not covered by the anti-cheat SDK, you can customize a script to block it based on how it works. The script will be dynamically delivered to the game client and parsed by the anti-cheat SDK running on the client to detect and block the custom cheat in a targeted manner.

### Core strengths: custom defense

Traditional anti-cheat capabilities usually perform general detection in cheating scenarios such as memory modification and game speed adjustment, which cover only general cheats and have difficulties in real-time defense against custom cheats. In contrast, the script-based defense solution makes such defense possible.

**A defense solution against a custom cheat is called a module, and there are public and private modules.** The former is released by ACE, and the latter is customized and developed according to your game's cheat scenarios and uploaded by yourself for use. You can select and subscribe to modules as needed by your game and develop and generate characteristics. After characteristics are released, you can develop defense policies based on the reported data to block cheats.
