## Overview of Anti-cheat SDK

Anti-cheat SDK is specially designed for mobile games and has powerful anti-debugging capabilities to comprehensively combat various cheats such as general trainers and speed adjusters.

Based on Tencent Games' over a decade of experience in game operations, the Anti-cheat SDK features proprietary detection technologies and comprehensive and stable policy models for outstanding game protection. Its general trainer and speed adjuster defense solutions can force games to quit once detecting a cheat. In addition, it adopts proprietary anti-variant technologies and multi-policy detection models to effectively prevent variants and avoid misjudgments.

Anti-cheat SDK has been widely used on all the mobile games of Tencent Games and many mobile games of dozens of game companies, including blockbusters with tens of millions DAUs such as Honor of Kings and CrossFire Mobile. It covers over 2,000 device models and protects hundreds of millions of players, fully proving its defense effect and stability.

### Anti-trainer feature

There are various types of ever-emerging trainers in the market, such as Huluxia, SBgametool, GameKiller, GameGuardian, and Huangyouxiugaidashi. If games aren't protected against such trainers, various key game data can be easily modified, including coins, health, and attack.

The SDK conducts targeted game protection against common trainer measures, which can detect trainers and force games to quit once trainers are found. In the face of such defense, cheat writers generally release different cheat versions and variants. To solve this, the SDK extracts core characteristics of cheats to accurately identify cheat variants.

### Speed adjuster detection

Speed changing is divided into two types: acceleration and deceleration. The former can save players' time, and the latter can make gameplay easier. Therefore, use of speed adjusters will seriously affect the game balance.

The SDK conducts in-depth analysis on various implementation principles of different speed adjusters and comprehensively monitors their speed changing behaviors, so as to **force games to quit as soon as speed adjusters are found**. In addition, **it also provides the anti-variant feature to accurately identify adjuster variants.**

### Anti-debugging

Cheat writers usually make targeted cheat features by dynamically debugging games. If a game has no protection in place, it can be debugged easily with tools such as GDB and IDA.

For anti-debugging scenarios, the anti-debugging solution of the SDK is continuously adjusted and optimized to avoid simple and rough judgments and quickly troubleshoot and fix compatibility issues in complex situations. **It has the following core strengths:**
* **It can quickly debug ptrace run in the system to provide all-around protection for all game threads and form a closed protection loop.**
* **Its high stability and compatibility have been tested on hundreds of millions of devices.**

### Half a day for complete connection

The SDK is encapsulated into two simple APIs for games to call. You can easily connect your game to the SDK by selecting an appropriate SDK version, calling the two APIs in proper places, and uploading the execution logs in the ACE console for acceptance inspection.

It takes only half a day on average to connect to the SDK, which is merely a short period of time for game development, truly delivering **24/7 protection after half day's effort**.
