# Guide of The Shell Solution

For the game security protection program provided by the platform, the user of the command line reinforcement tool
should ensure that the reinforcement operation is the final link of the application or game release. If the user
modifies or packs the reinforced apk or aab file for the second time, The platform will not Liability for any loss or
damage caused by this. Therefore, the platform recommends that users with multi-channel requirements must verify
that the game can run normally if they perform reinforcement operations first and then perform secondary
packaging.

## Suggestion

1. The Compatibility Shell Mode supports compatibility with common hot swap solutions and channel business repacking requirements;
2. Most of its functions are turned off by default and the protection function becomes weak, which is easy to produce a cracked version. For details, please refer to the [Risk Description](#risk-statement)

## INTRODUCTION

With this tool, The shell solution can be integrated into your continuous integration process and signature
process of game. It can be automatically shelled and signed with one line of code.

**Pay attention:**

1. This tool only supports the Android version of the game.
2. Operating System Supported：Windows / MAC OS / Linux (For Windows and Linux systems, x86 and
   x64 versions are provided separately. Please confirm the operating system configuration of your computer
   before selecting the tool version.)
3. When the tool is running, the game will be authenticated first. The platform will issue a cert format certificate for
   each game. If there is no correct game certificate in your toolkit, please contact customer service.
4. This tool provides two shell: APK-single shell/ AAB-single shell
5. Before calling the tool on the MAC or Linux systems, you should execute the following operations in the
   directory where the tool is located firstly.
   
   ```xml
   cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
   chmod -R 777 ./*
   ```

## APK Shell

**HOW TO USE：**

```cmd
cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
MTPClientConsole.exe -d <gameId> <apkpath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
<configPath> -s <symbolpath>
```

## App Bundle Shell

Android AppBundle file produced by packaging with Google's latest apk dynamic packaging and dynamic componentization technology. By filling in and calling the configuration file, you can freely choose to encrypt the specified .so files and .dll files. The shelling mode of AppBundle client does not support some kind of verification modes so these files in the AppBundle will be verified by default.

**HOW TO USE：**

```cmd
cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
MTPClientConsole.exe -a <gameId> <aabPath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
<configPath> -s <symbolpath>
```

**PARAMETER DESCRIPTION：**

Parameter | Meaning
---|---
-a | AppBundle Edition(default)
gameId | GameId (Console registration)

**DESCRIPTION OF tpshell-config.xml：**

**DESCRIPTION OF config.json：**

Configuration item | Meaning
---|---
TPVersion|Required field, specify shell version number
ToolPath | The tool will depend on the tools directory information in the toolkit.Please fill in the complete absolute path of the tools directory.(Don't add quotes.)
Sign | Optional, the signing certificate information provided by the game developer
keystorePath | the path of the key file, string type (Please fill in the absolute path.)
keyPass | the password of keystore, string type
storePass | the password of repository, string type
aliaName | another name, string type
EncSo | It's the list of .so files you want to encript. Please only select the core files, otherwise game performance will be affected.(Don't add quotes.)

is_use_application_name | Required field, Whether to use application name as the key, Value is 'true' or 'false'
is_weak_version | Required field, Whether to use compatibility mode, Value is 'true' or 'false'
mergelf3_enc_exports | Required field, Whether to enable this feathre, Value is 'true' or 'false'
mergelf3_disorder_imports | Required field, Whether to enable this feathre, Value is 'true' or 'false'

**Pay attention:**

***About TPVersion：**
it is recommended to use the default version from the command-line tool. if you need
to change the version, please contact us.

***About signature：**
if you use local signature, you needn't to upload the certificate and add the certificate informaton. only the
keystorePath, storePass, keyPass, aliaName signature information is filled in, and the command line tool will
keep the same signature version before and after the reinforcement by default; if it is not filled, filled in
incorrectly or the package to be reinforced is not signed It is not signed by default, and the game after
reinforcement needs to be signed manually.Generally speaking, aab packages only use v1 signatures.

***About the list of encrypted files：**
if list of EncSo are empty or not filled, it will use the background default
configuration to encrypt the files such as `libmono.so` , `libil2cpp.so` .

***About the global-metadata encryption：**
The extparams field is the configuration used to encrypt globalmetadata when the il2cpplso file is encrypted,This feature is turned off by default and supports custom configuration in the latest shell version.

***About hardening keys：**
The is_use_application_name field is used to use the application name as a part of the decryption so key to enhance the defense effect. This feature is turned off by default and custom configuration is only supported in hardened version 2.6 and above. If it is enabled, only is_use_application_name:true needs to be configured.

***About the resource file list：**
APK Shell Mode and App Bundle Shell do not support file verification by default,custom configuration is only supported in hardened version 2.6 and above.

***About speed upload：**
this version of the tool has integrated the Extreme Upload feature to streamline
network transfer and increase transfer speed, so you needn't to upload the complete apk file.

## COMMON RETURN RESULTS

Parameter | Meaning
---|---
The shelling task was finished | Success
Shell failed for time out | Fail
Configuration error | Fail
Command line parameter error| Fail
Shelling error| Fail
Local client error| Fail
Server error| Fail

## RISK STATEMENT

The Shell doesn't protect the unchecked files, and if the files is modified by players, The shell will not deal with it. Related information:

1. When shelling, if binary file is not checked, the player will modify and replace the binary files and generates a cracked installation package.
2. When shelling, if class.dex file is not checked. the player will delete the java code and causes some features to be unavailable.
3. When shelling, if class.dex file is not checked. the player will modify dex file to load the so file, so as to achieve the purpose of modifying the game logic and generating a cracked installation package.


## EXAMPLE CODE

**Pay attention**

Shell involves many io operations, considering the machine cpu and network bandwidth, it is recommended
that the number of threads opened at the same time is no more than 10, and specific numbers can be
adjusted depends on machine performance, a large number of installation packages can be handled in
batches by thread pool.
