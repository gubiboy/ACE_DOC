# Guide of The Shell Solution

For the game security protection program provided by the platform, the user of the command line reinforcement tool
should ensure that the reinforcement operation is the final link of the application or game release. If the user
modifies or packs the reinforced apk or aab file for the second time, The platform will not Liability for any loss or
damage caused by this. Therefore, the platform recommends that users with multi-channel requirements must verify
that the game can run normally if they perform reinforcement operations first and then perform secondary
packaging.

## Suggestion

The following suggestions are provided in combination with current shelling issues and Google Developer
Specifications:

1. Try to ensure that the so files are consistent under each architecture. If a file does not exist under a
certain architecture, choose to delete or complete it.
2. Try to ensure that the Shelling solutions are not mixed. If there are conflicts, shield the solutions for
troubleshooting.
3. Try not to upgrade minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion arbitrarily. During the upgrade process, you need
to refer to relevant guidelines in the official Google documentation.
4. Try not to replace the signing certificate arbitrarily, there is a problem that cannot be installed due to
overwriting.
5. Try not to select too many so or dll when shelling, so as to avoid the performance impact.
6. The so file protection function requires the shelled so file to contain the .init_array section, if not, contact
customer service.


## INTRODUCTION

With this tool, The shell solution can be integrated into your continuous integration process and signature
process of game. It can be automatically shelled and signed with one line of code.

**Pay attention:**

1. This tool only supports the Android version of the game.

2. Operating System Supported：Windows / MAC OS / Linux (For Windows and Linux systems, x86 and
x64 versions are provided separately. Please confirm the operating system configuration of your computer
before selecting the tool version.)

3. When the tool is running, the game will be authenticated first. The platform will issue a cert format certificate for
each game. If there is no correct game certificate in your toolkit, please contact customer service.

4. This tool provides two shell: APK-single shell/ AAB-single shell

5. Before calling the tool on the MAC or Linux systems, you should execute the following operations in the
directory where the tool is located firstly.

    ```xml
    cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
    chmod -R 777 ./*
    ```

**Multi-channel attention**

1. if you need to shell several game packages from different application markets, please script by refering to [the example code](#example-code) on the buttom of article to scripting.
2. if you need to make multi-channel package on the shelled game, please use the CUSTOM MODE and cancel the verification of files which modified by channel in the configuration file during shelling.

## APK Shell

cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
MTPClientConsole.exe -d <gameId> <apkpath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
<configPath> -s <symbolpath>
```

## App Bundle Shell

Android AppBundle file produced by packaging with Google's latest apk dynamic packaging and dynamic componentization technology. By filling in and calling the configuration file, you can freely choose to encrypt the specified .so files and .dll files. The shelling mode of AppBundle client does not support some kind of verification modes so these files in the AppBundle will be verified by default.

```cmd
cd where_your_mtpclientconsole_dir
MTPClientConsole.exe -a <gameId> <aabPath> <outDir> <certPath> -c 
<configPath> -s <symbolpath>

**Pay attention:**

***About TPVersion：**
it is recommended to use the default version from the command-line tool. if you need
to change the version, please contact us.

***About signature：**
if you use local signature, you needn't to upload the certificate and add the certificate informaton. only the
keystorePath, storePass, keyPass, aliaName signature information is filled in, and the command line tool will
keep the same signature version before and after the reinforcement by default; if it is not filled, filled in
incorrectly or the package to be reinforced is not signed It is not signed by default, and the game after
reinforcement needs to be signed manually.Generally speaking, aab packages only use v1 signatures.

***About the list of encrypted files：** if list of EncSo and EncDll are empty or not filled, it will use the background default configuration to encrypt the files such as libmono.so, libil2cpp.so, Assembly-CSharp.dll and Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll.

***About the global-metadata encryption：**
The extparams field is the configuration used to encrypt global-metadata, If you don't need this function, you can directly delete the extparams configuration. the global-metadata encryption function is enabled by default in the latest shell version.

***About hardening keys：**
The is_use_application_name field is used to use the application name as a part of the decryption so key to enhance the defense effect. Considering that some channels will modify the application name and cause the hardening crash, custom configuration is only supported in hardened version 2.6 and above. If it is enabled, only is_use_application_name:true needs to be configured.

***About the resource file list：**
APK Shell Mode, all files are verified by default, and it supports custom configuration verification file range; 
App Bundle Shell，the resource files are not verified by default, and it does not support custom configuration verification file range;

***About speed upload：**
this version of the tool has integrated the Extreme Upload feature to streamline
network transfer and increase transfer speed, so you needn't to upload the complete apk file.

***About selecting files for verification：** in FileCheck name, the root node is the default action ("+" is checked, "-" is unchecked). When you need to perform the opposite action from the node, you can add it into the selector attribute.For example, in the configuration file, the assets/bin directory is not selected. When the assets/bin/Data/Managed directory is selected, all the options in it are selected, then deselect the UnityEngine.dll file and System.dll file in it. Select all child files of the assets/bin/Data/Resourses directory. Then deselect all child files of the res/layout directory, only select the check_ permission _layout.xml in it.(It can be equivalent to the following operations in web shelling.)

## COMMON RETURN RESULTS

Parameter | Meaning
---|---
The shelling task was finished | Success
Shell failed for time out | Fail
Configuration error | Fail
Command line parameter error| Fail
Shelling error| Fail
Local client error| Fail
Server error| Fail

## The effect of shelling

Reinforcement will fully protect the game resources. The plug-in author adds, deletes, and changes any resources in the game. Reinforcement will immediately exit the game.If the game uses both anti-plug-in and reinforcement solutions, the anti-plug-in crash protection function is enabled by default, and the crash request needs to obtain the openid, that is, the game side calls the setuserinfo interface to take effect. If the game has not been logged in for a long time, consider the registration time of different games , It is expected to crash in about 5 minutes without logging in.[Download apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/)

**Determine whether to shell**
Check whether the `libtprt.so` file exists in the corresponding architecture directory of the lib directory in the installation package; if it exists, the installation package has been hardened;

**The Shelling effect verification**

```xml
1. apktool d apkPath; # Use apktool to decompress the apk file
2. apktool b apkPath; # Use apktool to repackage the apk file
3. After the installation package is re-signed, it will exit the game immediately after reinforcement.
```

**Determine whether to crash**

```bash
# 查看logcat信息中存在cleanly(1-30)的信息，例如：Process 15407 exited cleanly (30)
adb shell 
su
logcat d|grep "cleanly"
```

## EXAMPLE CODE

**Pay attention**

Shell involves many io operations, considering the machine cpu and network bandwidth, it is recommended
that the number of threads opened at the same time is no more than 10, and specific numbers can be
adjusted depends on machine performance, a large number of installation packages can be handled in
batches by thread pool.
